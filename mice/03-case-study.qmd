* We'll focus on the analyses among the participants >60 years old

## Design: Case-Cohort

```{r}
tibble(
  Cohort =  "Age > 60",
  `Total N` = 5263,
  `PCa Deaths` = 227,
  `PCa Dx` = 780,
  `PCa with Markers` = 702,
  `Control with Markers` = 1753,
  `Control without Markers` = 2730
) %>%
  gt::gt() %>%
  gt::tab_source_note("PCa = Prostate Cancer")
```

Study Aims:

1. Estimate the distribution of PSA.

1. Are the kallikrein markers better at predicting prostate cancer death than PSA alone?

1. Estimate the reclassification using additional markers compared to PSA alone.
