-   We'll focus on the analyses among the participants \>60 years old

## Study Design

What is the study design?

-   Nested Case-Control

-   A case-control study nested within a cohort

## Study Design: Nested Case-Control

```{r}
tibble(
  Cohort =  "Age > 60",
  `Total N` = 5263,
  `PCa Deaths` = 227,
  `PCa Dx` = 780,
  `PCa with Markers` = 702,
  `Control with Markers` = 1753,
  `Control without Markers` = 2730
) %>%
  gt::gt() %>%
  gt::tab_source_note("PCa = Prostate Cancer")
```

Study Aims:

1.  Estimate the distribution of PSA.

2.  Are the kallikrein markers better at predicting prostate cancer death than PSA alone?

3.  Estimate the reclassification using additional markers compared to PSA alone.

* Risk of death from prostate cancer among men providing blood at age 60--73 yr who had PSA ***≥***2.0 ng/ml, split by four-kallikrein panel risk at 7.5% at baseline.

* The black line indicates the risk of prostate cancer death among all men with baseline PSA ***≥***2.0 ng/ml, gold line indicates the risk of prostate cancer death among men with PSA ***≥***2.0 ng/ml and four-kallikrein panel score ***≥***7.5% at baseline, and blue line indicates risk of prostate cancer death among men with PSA ***≥***2.0 ng/ml and four-kallikrein panel score \<7.5% at baseline.
