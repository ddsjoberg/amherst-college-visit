# Multiple Imputation Review

## MICE Review

Multiple imputation consists of three steps:

1. Imputation step. M imputations (completed datasets) are generated under some chosen imputation model.

2. Completed-data analysis (estimation) step. The desired analysis is performed separately on each imputation m = 1, . . . , M. This is called completed-data analysis and is the primary analysis to be performed once missing data have been imputed.

3. Pooling step. The results obtained from M completed-data analyses are combined into a single multiple-imputation result. Variance is estimated by taking into the account with variability within each of the 'completed-data' analyses, and the variation across the M analyses.
