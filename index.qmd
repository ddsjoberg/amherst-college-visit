The [**gtsummary**](https://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/) package provides an elegant and flexible way to create publication-ready summary tables in **R**. 
A critical part of the work of statisticians, data scientists, and analysts is summarizing data sets and regression models in R and publishing or sharing polished summary tables.
The [**gtsummary**](https://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/) package was created to streamline these everyday analysis tasks by allowing users to easily create reproducible summaries of data sets, regression models, survey data, and survival data with a simple interface and very little code.
The package follows a tidy framework, making it easy to integrate with standard data workflows, and offers many table customization features through function arguments, helper functions, and custom themes.
