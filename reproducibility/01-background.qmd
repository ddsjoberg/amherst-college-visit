## European Urology 

* European Urology journal asked all accepted manuscripts a few questions prior to publication:
  
  1. Was any code used to prepare these results?
  
  2. Are you willing to share that code?
  
* Of 314 accepted manuscripts with non-trivial analyses, only 40 reported that they used code.

* Of the 40, 18 submitted code to the journal

* All 18 sets of submitted code had some issues (no comments in the code, large amounts of repeated code prone to error, results were not exported reproducibly with R markdown/SAS ODS, etc)
